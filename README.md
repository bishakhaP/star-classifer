🌟 Star Classifier - Giant vs Dwarf Stars       
This project uses machine learning logistic regression model to classify stars as Giant or Dwarf based on key astronomical features.

🔹 Features Used

B–V Color Index - indicates stellar temperature     
Absolute Magnitude (Amag) - intrinsic brightness    
Parallax (mas) - distance indicator

🔹 How it Works

1. A machine learning logistic regression model is trained on real stellar data [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesmsuic/star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs)
2. User inputs are collected through an interactive web interface
3. The model predicts the star type along with confidence

🔹 Tech Stack

Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn     
FastAPI (backend)       
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)

🔹 Live Demo

🔹 Why this project?

I built this project to combine my interest in astronomy with machine learning and to understand the full ML workflow from data analysis to deployment.
